                    I currently live in Oregon with my girlfriend and our two cats.
                    My web development journey started when I was 14 in high school and I took a class on HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
                    I enjoyed writing code and seeing how I could create an application that could be used by others to help them.
                    Computers and technology has always interested me and I love learning about how they work and how I can use them to make my life easier.
                    I took a couple more classes in high school which covered more advanced topics like SQL and PHP.
                    Ever since I took those classes I have wanted to further my knowledge in web development.
                    Fast forward to 2023, I decided to take the leap and enroll in a coding bootcamp to further my knowledge in web development.
                    I finished a coding bootcamp through the University of Oregon in spring of 2024 and I am currently looking for a job in web development.
